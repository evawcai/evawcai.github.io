 <p>生命其实都是一样的。活着的就是生命。死了就没有了生命。 <br>
所有活着的都是生命。牲畜，天空的飞鸟，海里的鱼，还有植物。 <br>
生命是人不能创造的。人只能繁衍。 <br>
Life are all the same. Living is life. Once died, no more life.  <br>
Everyting living is life. Catttles, birds in the air, fish in the sea, and plants. <br>
No man can create life. Men can only multiply it. <br>
Or care it. Or hurt it. <br>
照顾生命。伤害生命。 <br>
神是生命的主。God is the Lord of life. <br></p>

<p>生命是用来做什么的呢？怎样才是有价值地用了生命而不是浪费生命呢？<br>
What is life use for? How is it using life in a right way instead of wasting it? <br>
For a long long time, I don't understand life, even the basic of it. <br>
很长很长的时间里，我不明白生命，甚至生命最基本的东西。 <br>
Is it good education? Is it success of career? Is it riches? Or is it love? <br>
是高等教育吗？是事业成功吗？还是财富？抑或爱情？ <br>
None of it. <br>
都不是。 <br>
How to understand it? How to know it? <br>
怎么理解它呢？怎么知道它呢？ <br>
是读书吗？By reading? <br>
读世上哲人智者写的文学哲学吗？ <br>
Reading the literature, the philosophy written by wise men or famous writers? <br>
No。不是的。 <br>
Their writting is like polluted water.他们所写的就像是污染了的水。 <br>
In fact hearing real people talking about real life is better than reading those books.实际上听周围的人讲真实的日常生活也比读那些书好。 <br>
Wisdom is gained by reading God's word. Every word.智慧是从读神的话来的。每句话. <br>
